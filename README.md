# VRVM 
VRVM - Variational Relevance Vector Machine

This is a repo for python code to implement a fully Bayesian treatment of relevance vector machines, this is an implementation of the publication 
C. Bishop and M. Tipping, "Variational Relevance Vector Machines,” in Proc. 16th Conf. Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, 2000, pp. 46–53.

Includes a module for regression, as well as an example of how to use it. 

ToDo: 
- [ ] Check code stability for regression. 
- [ ] Update module to include classification
- [ ] Include example usage for classification
