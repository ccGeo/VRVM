# VRVM 
VRVM - Variational Relevance Vector Machine

This is a repo for python code to implement a fully Bayesian treatment of relevance vector machines. 

First pass includes a module for regression, as well as an example of how to use it. 

ToDo: 
[] Check code stability for regression. 
[] Update module to include classification
[] Include example usage for classification
